ASP.NET Core Web API with Google BigQuery
This code repo provides an example for ASP.NET Core Web API and Google BigQuery.

If you are new to BigQuery the here is a definition from google according to https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/what-is-bigquery.
Storing and querying massive datasets can be time consuming and expensive without the right hardware and infrastructure. BigQuery is an enterprise data warehouse that solves this problem by enabling super-fast SQL queries using the processing power of Google's infrastructure. Simply move your data into BigQuery and let us handle the hard work. You can control access to both the project and your data based on your business needs, such as giving others the ability to view or query your data.

You can access BigQuery by using the Cloud Console or the classic web UI, by using a command-line tool, or by making calls to the BigQuery REST API using a variety of client libraries such as Java, .NET, or Python. There are also a variety of third-party tools that you can use to interact with BigQuery, such as visualizing the data or loading the data.

BigQuery is fully-managed. To get started, you don't need to deploy any resources, such as disks and virtual machines. Get started now by running a web query or using the command-line tool.
